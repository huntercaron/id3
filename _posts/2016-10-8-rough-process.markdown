This is a collection of my rough work. Starting with sketchbook work.

Really quick overall goals for the first week. Outlining what is really important with this project, and some immediate things to do.

A large part of this project was trying to accommodate every type of person. This was trying to organize them into user stories/jobs to be done. However, it didn't seem. Like the most efficient way to do things.

Mapping out the different user experiences seemed to be a much better way to do things. This is the beginning of that.

Here I try to plan out some of the copy, as well as outline the basics of a PACT analysis as I try to gather my thoughts.

This is the planning of the Kiosk interface that never ended up being executed. I lot of thought has gone into how it will work and is something I plan on completing in the second part of this project.

This project has been a really interesting experience for me and looking back on this process I can start to pin point problems within it. Luckily I can improve on these things in project 2B.
