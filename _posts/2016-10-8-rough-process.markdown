Here I am really planning out the initial stages of the question the user might want answered (left) and the initial high level flow of the site design (right). On the left I also sketch out the martini glass approach to information design and how that would help my site.

Here I am going deeper into planning the site in a storyboard-esc way. On the right I plan out some important design principles, as well as ideas for visual inspiration. This is also where the initial heart idea comes about.

Here I deep dive into ways of creating depth, that are commonly used in cinematography. This is arguably the last time that a unique idea besides the square grid was thought about. A lot of research went into creating depth and scale, but none of it was really used.

This is perhaps the hardest one to follow. as it starts in the middle then goes up and around. It really explains the full process of what I wanted each section to be and the takeaways from it. At the top you can see some fairly unique ideas, like doing this all in a force directed layout, but I didn't have the dev prowess or time.

Here are some of my sketches for what the scale diagram should have been. Some super rough math sketches show that if I massaged the data, units, etc. I could make the data be 'be' the height of England twice over if it was on usb drives. Which is also about halfway across the United States.

That's all I could find rough work wise. My process for this project isn't all that I hoped it could be. I hope to do better in project two. I like product design process more anyways.
