It was surprising for me to discover that there is actually very little data about big data. 

There is some rough and estimated info about how much data some companies have or generate on the daily, along with some other little tidbits. Overall though, I was underwhelmed. Yeah sure companies like Palantir and Facebook a pretty much powered by data, but there is actually very little hard data about that.

At this point I know I should focus on achieving the "aha" moment of educating people about how big big data really is. I have shifted gears due to the amount of data. I think this approach will be more interesting to the average user anyways.
