Honestly, I’m writing this post-mortem. 

Being a designer and a developer is great at times. Being able to control the entire process in incredibly finite detail is amazing, but the main problem that always comes up is time. I’m always pushing myself to do great things. However, when I want to do great things as a designer and a developer corners have to be cut. In this project I moved onto dev because I knew I had to in order to finish on time, and the design of the project is not as good as I would’ve liked. With the most important part of my project (the scale grid section), I switched to dev brain before it was time. The “aha” moment I was banking on, didn’t happen.

This was however, a learning experience. After all that is what I’m here for. In retrospect I should have spent more time thinking through the various different parts in a more high fidelity fashion. You can tell what I did and didn’t thoroughly plan out. I have rethought that whole section, using physical things such as usb drives and lining them up to be roughly twice the size of England, which I think will work a lot better. It is now; once again; a matter of development.
