![style0]({{ site.github.url }}/assets/style0.png)

This has been the progress for visual comp/style tile directions. I originally went for a dark theme that is relatively common with data related stuff, but it felt too intimidating.

![style1]({{ site.github.url }}/assets/style1.png)

After the initial one I decided I didn't like the type, and should go for a more subtle and elegant approach. I liked the idea of smaller type and a serif display face.

![style2]({{ site.github.url }}/assets/style2.png)

This is where I settled upon the final design approach that I ended up using. Of course I always want to do better, but I think it still works pretty well. A big improvement from the first one at least.

Here is a framer prototype with the final VC. Put into Framer to feel what scrolling would be like. [Framer Prototype][framer]
