Zilin and I iterated a lot on the visuals, UI, UX and IA of the site. Here is a look at some of the iterations.

This can best be seen in the difference between the site from the original due date, and the final site (final for the purposes of this half of the project).

[Old Site](http://huntercaron.com/Mercuri/old.html)

A lot more changes than these screenshots show, and a lot more is going to change. We should have kept better records of our process. Will attempt to do so for project 2B.
