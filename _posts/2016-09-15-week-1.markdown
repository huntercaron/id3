Another year, another process doc. Welcome.

Writing this after the first week of class, having just chosen the Topic of _Big Data_. I chose this topic for various reasons.

- Not many people know what big data is
- Those who don't are possibly scared of it
- Big data is VERY useful

## The Plan

1. Explain and visualize what big data is. Visualize the sheer scale of big data
2. Show where all this data is. What companies have it, where in the world it is, etc.
3. Explain the benefits of big data
- For me
- For Companies
- For Humanity
