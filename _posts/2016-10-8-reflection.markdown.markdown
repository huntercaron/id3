As usual, I like to include some post project thoughts in my process. This project warrants then more than most.

I love working in groups. I try to be very aware of my (decently numerous) weaknesses as a designer. Working in groups allows me to not only work with people who are stronger than me in those areas, but also use the opportunity to learn from them. This group felt different, with incredible talents in very different sectors. I've never worked with someone who works _too_ hard, but in a different direction of the one the group decided on. I had no idea how to harness the potential of that and I think I could've done more to unify us. We felt somewhat disconnected throughout the process, whether geographically or visually and I think that ended up hindering us. It's been a great learning experience. 

But I think the biggest failure was on my part. I put myself first to get some jobs, and that was a selfish thing to do. We started the project with big dreams and I took on some of the management roles, but did not properly keep up with them throughout. With incredibly talented people in the group, I think we could've done better, and a lot of that rested on me. It still feels half baked to me, but luckily there is still another half of the project left. On a positive note, we have learned a lot and have made plans that will help us execute better as a unified team.
